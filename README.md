# Self-Selecting Semi-Supervised Transformer-Attention Convolutional Network for Four Class EEG-Based Motor Imagery Decoding

### Results Overview

## Dependencies

Models were trained and tested by a single GPU, Nvidia GTX 2070 8GB (Driver Version: 512.78, CUDA 11.3), using Python 3.7 with TensorFlow framework. Anaconda 3 was used on Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS and Windows 11. The following packages are required:

TensorFlow 2.7
matplotlib 3.5
NumPy 1.20
scikit-learn 1.0
SciPy 1.7

## Datasets

The BCI Competition IV-2a dataset needs to be downloaded, and the data path should be set in the 'data_path' variable in the main_TrainValTest.py file. The dataset can be downloaded from here.
